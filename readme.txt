Build SpringMVC from Intellij Example

New Project ==> Spring ==> Spring MVC

Created MyAction for Controller
Modified web.xml and dispatcher-servlet.xml for showing jsp and config location
Created hello.jsp
Created WEB-INF/config for dispatcher-servlet.xml, applicationContext.xml  excluding web.xml
Created WEB-INF/views  for hello.jsp....etc
Modified web.xml and dispatcher-servlet.xml for showing jsp and config location, again~

Run Tomcat and see them on the browser!!

by the way: The 'Struts' in the project name is just a mistake.... XDDD

Enjoy it~~~
